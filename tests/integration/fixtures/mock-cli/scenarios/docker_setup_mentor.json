    "Docker is not installed on this system. You need to install it first. For Ubuntu/Debian: 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io'. For macOS: download Docker Desktop from docker.com. For Windows: install Docker Desktop or use WSL2 with Docker. The tutorial should include installation instructions as a prerequisite.",
    "The Docker daemon is not running. On Linux, start it with 'sudo systemctl start docker'. On macOS/Windows with Docker Desktop, open the Docker Desktop application. The tutorial should mention that Docker needs to be running, not just installed.",
    "On Linux, you need to either use 'sudo' before docker commands, or add your user to the docker group with 'sudo usermod -aG docker $USER' and then log out and back in (or run 'newgrp docker'). The tutorial should explain this Linux-specific requirement.",
    "The tutorial is complete. You've learned the basics of running Docker containers."

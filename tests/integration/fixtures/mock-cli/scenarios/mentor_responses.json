    "To install npm, you need to first install Node.js. On Ubuntu/Debian, run: sudo apt-get install nodejs npm. On macOS with Homebrew, run: brew install node. The tutorial assumes Node.js is already installed, which is a missing prerequisite.",
    "You need to update the package.json file. Add a 'bin' field to make the script executable: add '\"bin\": { \"counter\": \"./counter.js\" }' to your package.json. The tutorial is unclear about this.",
    "You need to make the script executable by running: chmod +x counter.js. The tutorial doesn't mention this step, which is required before running scripts directly with ./",
    "Great work! The tutorial has been completed successfully."
